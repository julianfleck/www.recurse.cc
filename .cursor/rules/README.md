# Workspace Guidance for AI Models

- Biome handles class name sorting and other stylistic fixes automatically in this codebase.
- Do not spend time reordering Tailwind classes or adjusting minor stylistic class order; leave as-is.
- Focus on correctness, accessibility, type safety, and functional changes.
- When lints mention class sorting or cosmetic order, you may ignore them. They will be resolved by the formatter.
