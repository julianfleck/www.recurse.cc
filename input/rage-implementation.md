# RAGE Implementation Status and Roadmap

## Current Implementation: A Solid Foundation

We've successfully built a working foundation that demonstrates the core RAGE concepts in practice. The system can ingest documents, extract structured knowledge, and provide intelligent search and retrieval capabilities.

### What We've Built So Far

**Backend Infrastructure:**
We have a modern, scalable backend built with FastAPI that provides a RESTful API for all RAGE operations. The system uses Neo4j as a graph database to store frame instances and their relationships, with built-in vector search capabilities for semantic similarity. Redis handles task queuing and caching, while Celery workers process documents in parallel with progress tracking. For vector embeddings, we use HuggingFace's E5-mistral-7b-instruct model, which provides 4096-dimensional embeddings optimized for semantic understanding.

**Data Architecture:**
The system uses Pydantic models throughout for type safety and validation. We have a centralized frame registry that manages all frame schemas with dynamic registration capabilities. Documents are stored in a hierarchical structure called SemanticDocument that preserves the original document organization while embedding extracted frames. Search results are enhanced with metadata and confidence scoring to help users understand the quality of retrieved information.

**Infrastructure:**
The entire system runs in Docker containers orchestrated with Docker Compose, making it easy to deploy and scale. We have an Nginx reverse proxy for API routing and SSL termination, and a file system vault for document storage with content hashing to prevent duplicate processing.

### Current Infrastructure: Built for Scale

The system runs on a modern microservices architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

**Core Services:**
- **FastAPI Application**: RESTful API with async endpoints and comprehensive OpenAPI documentation
- **Neo4j Graph Database**: Storage for frame instances and relationships with vector search capabilities
- **Redis**: Task queue and caching layer for Celery workers
- **Celery Workers**: Parallel processing for document ingestion with progress tracking
- **HuggingFace Embeddings**: Vector similarity using E5-mistral-7b-instruct (4096 dimensions)

**Infrastructure Features:**
- **Async Processing**: Documents are processed in the background with progress tracking
- **Scalable Architecture**: Multiple Celery workers can process documents in parallel
- **Monitoring**: Flower dashboard for task monitoring and management
- **Development Tools**: Hot reloading, comprehensive logging, and debugging capabilities
- **Production Ready**: Docker Compose setup with proper service orchestration

### How the System Currently Works

**Document Processing Pipeline:**
When you upload a document to RAGE, here's what happens:

1. **Document Upload**: The system accepts text content with metadata through a REST API endpoint
2. **Deduplication**: It checks if the content already exists using SHA-256 content hashing to avoid processing the same document twice
3. **Section Parsing**: The document is broken down into hierarchical sections using Markdown and Obsidian parsers, preserving the original document structure
4. **Frame Extraction**: The system uses structured output capabilities with Pydantic models to reliably extract frames from text using AI classification
5. **Graph Storage**: The extracted frames are stored in Neo4j with proper indexing and relationships
6. **Embedding Generation**: Vector embeddings are created for each frame using HuggingFace's E5-mistral-7b-instruct model for semantic search
7. **Background Processing**: All of this happens in parallel using Celery workers, with progress tracking so you can monitor the processing

**Frame Extraction Process:**
The system uses AI structured output capabilities with Pydantic models to reliably extract frames from text. Each frame type is validated against registered schemas, with automatic case normalization to handle variations in how the AI might label content. The system assigns confidence scores based on multiple factors: how well the text matches the expected frame type, how completely the required slots are filled, and how well the frame fits into the surrounding context. Most importantly, the system supports nested structures - frames can contain other frames, creating the recursive knowledge structures that make RAGE powerful.

**Search and Retrieval:**
When you search the system, it doesn't just find similar text - it finds semantically similar concepts with full context. The system searches across multiple indexes (frame content and summaries) and uses intelligent resolution to combine results. It expands the search context by traversing the graph around candidate frames, finding related information that might be relevant. Results are re-ranked using confidence-based weighting and frame type boosting to ensure the most relevant and reliable information appears first. When the system generates answers, it provides precise citations with numbered references so you can trace every piece of information back to its source.

### Current Frame System

**Frame Schema Registry:**
We've built a comprehensive frame system with 22 different frame types that cover everything from document-level classification to granular content analysis. The system supports recursive composition - frames can contain other frames through typed slots, creating the hierarchical knowledge structures that make RAGE powerful. Each frame type includes embedding hints that provide structural relationship guidance for classification, and the entire system uses Pydantic-based validation with confidence scoring. Most importantly, the system supports dynamic registration - new frame types can be added at runtime with proper validation.

**Frame Categories:**
The frame system is organized into several categories:

- **Core Proposition Frames (3):** `claim`, `hypothesis`, `thesis` - For central arguments and assertions
- **Support & Reasoning Frames (8):** `evidence`, `reference`, `method`, `method_step`, `tool`, `assumption`, `justification` - For supporting information and reasoning
- **Contrast & Opposition Frames (3):** `counterclaim`, `limitation`, `critique` - For opposing viewpoints and constraints
- **Elaboration & Framing Frames (5):** `definition`, `example`, `analogy`, `pattern`, `principle` - For explanations and clarifications
- **Navigational & Meta Frames (5):** `summary`, `question`, `instruction`, `context`, `future_work`, `meta` - For organization and guidance
- **Complex Structural Frames (2):** `claim_support_structure`, `argumentation_structure` - For organizing complex relationships

This comprehensive coverage means the system can handle diverse content types from academic research to technical documentation to personal notes, with each frame type designed to capture specific semantic patterns and relationships.

### API Endpoints

The RAGE API provides a unified interface with 6 main endpoint categories that support all core operations:

**`/v2/node/` - Node Access & Retrieval**
Primary endpoint for accessing individual nodes with flexible field selection, frame semantics, and relationship inclusion. Supports filtering by field sets (basic, content, metadata, semantics, relationships) and includes options for embeddings, children, parents, and contextual information.

**`/v2/tree/` - Tree Traversal & Graph Navigation**
Hierarchical navigation through the knowledge graph with configurable direction (children, parents, both, neighbors, root), depth control, and filtering by node types and relationship types. Essential for exploring document structure and frame relationships.

**`/v2/search/` - Search & Retrieval**
Advanced search capabilities including vector similarity search, AI-powered answer generation with Graph RAG, semantic search with comprehensive filtering, and metadata retrieval (tags, hypernyms, hyponyms). Supports multiple search strategies and reranking options.

**`/v2/documents/` - Document Management**
Complete document lifecycle management including creation with automatic processing, listing with pagination, and retrieval with full semantic structure. Handles content deduplication and provides processing status tracking.

**Graph Access (current)** - Direct `Neo4jClient` for internal operations; `/v2/tree/{id}` and search endpoints for public access
Direct graph database operations including Cypher query execution, atomic batch operations for complex updates, and comprehensive graph statistics. Provides low-level access to the Neo4j graph structure.

**`/v2/writing/` - Writing Assistance**
AI-powered writing support using knowledge graph context for text completion and rephrasing with various style options. Leverages the semantic understanding from extracted frames to provide contextually relevant suggestions.

## What We Need to Build Next

### Advanced Features: From Foundation to Innovation

The foundation we've built demonstrates the core RAGE concepts, but to realize the full vision of RAGE as a cognitive substrate that actively participates in understanding and reasoning, we need to build several advanced features:

### 1. Executable Operations Engine

**The Vision:** A system that doesn't just store knowledge, but knows how to work with knowledge. Each frame would carry instructions for what operations can be performed on it, and the system would actively suggest relevant actions.

**What this means:** Instead of having a fixed menu of actions (summarize, find related, generate questions), the system would understand your content and suggest contextually appropriate operations. For a hypothesis, it might suggest "generate test cases." For evidence, it might suggest "find contradictions." For a method, it might suggest "identify limitations."

**Technical Implementation:** We need to build an operation schema system similar to our frame schema system, with an execution engine that can discover, compose, and execute operations on frames.

### 2. Self-Bootstrapping Frame Registry

**The Vision:** Moving the frame registry from static code to the graph itself, enabling the system to bootstrap new frame types dynamically based on the content it processes.

**What this means:** Currently, frame schemas are defined in code and are static. With a graph-based frame registry, the extraction model could:
1. **Discover New Patterns**: When the AI encounters content that doesn't fit existing frame types, it could propose new frame schemas
2. **Register New Frames**: The system could automatically register new frame types with their slots and validation rules
3. **Evolve Over Time**: The frame registry would grow and adapt based on the types of content being processed
4. **Domain Adaptation**: Different domains (academic papers, code, personal notes) could develop specialized frame types

**Example:** The system processes a software engineering document and encounters patterns like "function signature," "parameter types," "return values" that don't fit existing frames. It could propose a new `function_definition` frame with slots for `function_name`, `parameters`, `return_type`, and `implementation_details`.

### 3. Archetypal Embedding System

**The Vision:** A system that gets smarter over time by learning what different types of content look like in various contexts. The system would continuously refine its understanding of what constitutes a "claim" or "evidence" based on the content it processes.

**What this means:** Currently, the system uses static rules to classify content. With archetypal embeddings, it would compute dynamic archetypes from validated instances and continuously update them as it learns. This would make the system much more accurate and context-aware.

### 4. Advanced Graph Operations

**The Vision:** A system that can perform complex reasoning across the knowledge graph, discovering patterns, inferring relationships, and generating insights that aren't explicitly stated.

**What this means:** Beyond simple retrieval, the system would be able to traverse complex paths through the graph, identify patterns across multiple documents, infer causal relationships, and generate new knowledge through reasoning.

### 5. Codebase Analysis Pipeline

**The Vision:** Extending RAGE to understand code structure and relationships, enabling sophisticated code analysis, refactoring suggestions, and architectural insights.

**What this means:** The system would be able to parse code files, extract methods, classes, and functions as frames, understand call relationships and dependencies, and provide insights about code quality, dead code detection, and architectural patterns.
