Recurse transforms your documents into structured knowledge that makes AI systems smarter. Here's how it works and the different ways you can use it.

## How Recurse Works

Recurse takes unstructured content—documents, articles, notes, code—and extracts structured knowledge using **RAGE** (Recursive, Agentic Graph Embeddings). The system:

1. **Processes** your sources to extract semantic units called **frames**
2. **Builds** a knowledge graph connecting related concepts
3. **Enables** your AI applications to query this structured knowledge

Unlike simple vector search, Recurse understands relationships, context, and structure—making your AI interactions more accurate and contextually aware.

## Two Main Paths

You can use Recurse in two primary ways, depending on your needs:

### Path 1: API (Manual Control)

Use the REST API to manually upload sources and search your knowledge graph. This gives you full control over what goes in and when.

**Best for:**
- Custom applications with specific workflows
- Precise control over content ingestion
- Building your own interfaces
- Specific search queries and retrieval

**How it works:**
- Upload documents via API
- Search using semantic or keyword queries
- Retrieve specific frames or nodes
- Build custom workflows

### Path 2: Proxy (Automatic Context)

Route your AI API calls through Recurse's proxy to automatically enrich requests with relevant context from your knowledge graph.

**Best for:**
- Chat applications
- AI assistants
- Automatic context injection
- Hands-off knowledge integration

**How it works:**
- Point your OpenAI (or compatible) client to Recurse's proxy
- Every request automatically includes relevant context
- Optionally persist useful outputs back to your graph
- Works with any OpenAI-compatible API

## Which Path Should You Choose?

Both paths can be used together, but here's when to pick each:

**Choose API if:**
- You need precise control over searches
- You're building custom workflows
- You want to manually manage content
- You need specific retrieval patterns

**Choose Proxy if:**
- You want automatic context injection
- You're building chat interfaces
- You prefer hands-off operation
- You want AI responses grounded in your knowledge

**Use both:**
- Upload content via API
- Route chat requests through proxy
- Get the best of both worlds
