This guide walks you through the prerequisites and helps you choose the right path to get started with Recurse. Whether you want a no-code interface, programmatic API access, or automatic context injection, we've got you covered.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need these three things:

<div className='fd-steps [&_h4]:fd-step'>

#### Get an AI Provider Key

Recurse works with any OpenAI-compatible provider. Get a key from:
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for GPT models
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) for Claude
- [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/) for DeepSeek models
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) for access to multiple models

<Callout type="info">
**Bring Your Own Key**: While in beta, Recurse operates on a bring-your-own-key basis. You use your own AI provider keys, and we handle the context injection and knowledge management. Not sure which provider or model to choose? Check our [model comparison guide](/docs/guides/model-comparison) to understand the tradeoffs.
</Callout>

#### Sign Up for Recurse

Create your account at [dashboard.recurse.cc/register](https://dashboard.recurse.cc/register). This gives you access to the chat interface, API, and proxy.

#### Configure Your AI Provider Key

Once signed up, navigate to your [settings](https://dashboard.recurse.cc/settings) and add your AI provider key. This enables the chat interface and proxy to make requests on your behalf.

    **Not sure which to use?** Understand the difference between direct API access and proxy-based context injection. This guide helps you choose the right approach for your use case.
  </Card>
  
  <Card href="/docs/getting-started/using-the-api" title="Using the API" icon="code">
    **Full programmatic control**. Upload sources, search your knowledge graph, navigate relationships, retrieve frames. Best for: custom applications, advanced integrations, agent builders.
  </Card>
  
  <Card href="/docs/getting-started/using-the-proxy" title="Using the Proxy" icon="arrow-right-left">
    **Easiest integration**. Change one line of code to add automatic context injection to existing applications. Best for: quick integration, existing AI apps, minimal code changes.

## Common Questions

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between the API and Proxy?">
    The **API** gives you direct control over uploads, search, and retrieval. The **Proxy** automatically injects context into your AI requests with minimal code changes. Read [API vs Proxy](/docs/getting-started/api-vs-proxy) to understand when to use each.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple approaches?">
    Absolutely. Many users combine the chat interface for exploration, the proxy for their main application, and direct API calls for specific operations. Your knowledge graph is accessible through all methods.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How long does source processing take?">
    Typically 10-60 seconds depending on source size and complexity. You can check processing status via the job ID returned on upload or through the dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I use this with Claude, Gemini, or other providers?">
    Yes. Any OpenAI-compatible API works with the proxy. For Anthropic's Claude, use the Anthropic base URL. For other providers, adjust the base URL accordingly. See our [model comparison guide](/docs/guides/model-comparison).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What are scopes and how should I use them?">
    Scopes organize your knowledge like folders or tags. Use them to separate projects, teams, or content types: `project:website-redesign`, `team:engineering`, `meeting_notes`. Queries and uploads both use scopes to keep related content together.
  </Accordion>
