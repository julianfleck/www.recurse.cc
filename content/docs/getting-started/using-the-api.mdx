title: Using the API
description: Direct API access for full control over content ingestion, retrieval, and graph navigation

For full control over uploads, search, and retrieval, use the API directly. This path gives you programmatic access to frame extraction, relationship navigation, and graph operations.

<Callout type="info">
**Prerequisites**: Make sure you've completed the [setup steps](/docs/getting-started/quickstart#prerequisites) (AI provider key, account signup, key configuration) before starting.
</Callout>

---

## Quick Start

1. **Generate your API key** at [API keys settings](https://dashboard.recurse.cc/settings/api-keys)
2. **Start uploading content** to build your knowledge graph
3. **Query your knowledge** with semantic search or navigate relationships

---

## Upload Content

Upload documents to your knowledge graph. Recurse processes them asynchronously—extracting frames, generating embeddings, mapping relationships.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.recurse.cc/documents/upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here" \
  -F "text=Frame semantics enable deep understanding by representing concepts as structured units with typed relationships." \
  -F "title=Frame Semantics Introduction" \
  -F "scope=getting_started"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "job_id": "job_abc123",
  "status": "processing",
  "document_id": "doc_xyz789"
}
```

Processing typically takes 10-60 seconds depending on content size.

**Upload options**:
- Text: `-F "text=Your content here"`
- Files: `-F "file=@document.pdf"`
- URLs: `-F "url=https://example.com/article"`

## Organize with Scopes

Scopes organize your knowledge like folders or tags. Assign scopes when uploading to keep related content together:

```bash
-F "scope=research-papers"
-F "scope=team:engineering"
-F "scope=projects:website-redesign"
```

Use scopes to filter queries later, making retrieval more focused and relevant.

---

## Search Your Knowledge

Once processing completes, query your knowledge graph:

```bash
curl "https://api.recurse.cc/search/?query=semantic:frame semantics&limit=5&scope=getting_started" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your_api_key_here"
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "query": "frame semantics",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "frame_abc123",
      "title": "Frame Semantics Introduction",
      "type": "Frame:Concept",
      "similarity_score": 0.94,
      "content": "Frame semantics enable deep understanding..."
    }
  ],
  "total_found": 1
}
```

**Query modes**:
- `semantic:your query` – Vector similarity search across frames
- `text:exact phrase` – Keyword matching
- Add `&scope=scope_name` to filter by collection
- Add `&frame_types=Claim,Evidence` to filter by frame type
