The fastest way to start using Recurse is through the web interface. Upload files, query your knowledge conversationally, and explore relationships visually. Perfect for researchers, writers, and anyone who wants to experience structured knowledge without writing code.

## Quick Start

1. **Log in** at [chat.recurse.cc](https://chat.recurse.cc)
2. **Upload content** via the chat interface or dashboard
3. **Start querying** your knowledge conversationally

---

## Upload Content

Drop files directly into the chat interface—PDFs, text files, markdown documents, Word docs. Recurse processes them, extracts semantic frames, and makes them queryable within 10-60 seconds depending on file size.

You can also paste text or URLs directly into the chat. The system recognizes URLs and fetches the content automatically.

**For batch uploads**, navigate to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.recurse.cc) upload section. This is useful when you have multiple documents to process at once—set scopes, upload multiple files simultaneously, and monitor processing status for all uploads.

---

## Organize with Scopes

Scopes organize your knowledge like folders or tags. When uploading content via the dashboard, assign scopes to keep related content together:

- `research-papers`
- `meeting-notes`
- `team:engineering`
- `projects:website-redesign`

Use scopes to focus queries later by tagging them with `#scope-name` in your questions.

---

## Query Your Knowledge

Once you've uploaded content, ask questions naturally in the chat interface. Recurse retrieves relevant frames and assembles them into context for your query.

**Focus with scopes**: Tag specific collections in your queries to scope retrieval:
- `#research-papers What are the main approaches to frame semantics?`
- `#meeting-notes What did we decide about the API design?`
- `#projects:website-redesign What's our deployment process?`

**Ask naturally**: The system navigates frame relationships to answer structural questions:
- "What's the relationship between X and Y?"
- "How does this concept connect to that paper?"
- "What evidence supports this claim?"
- "When did our understanding of this change?"
