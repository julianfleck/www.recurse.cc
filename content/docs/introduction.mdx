Most AI memory systems work by looking at query similarity – you ask a question, get back stuff that looks similar to your question, and that's it. This works if you already know what you're looking for. But it systematically prevents discovery. You can't find connections you didn't know existed, can't stumble onto context from unexpected places, can't explore ideas that branch away from your original query.

Recurse is built on different principles: **structure over similarity**, **relationships over rankings**, **evolution over static storage**. We are building infrastructure for sense-making, not just retrieval. For exploration, not just question-answering. For building understanding, not just finding facts.

We treat memory as a living structure – one you can navigate yourself and share with others. So that instead of asking "what's most similar?" you can ask "what connects?", "what supports this?", "how did my understanding evolve?" Those are fundamentally different questions that require fundamentally different infrastructure.

## How Recurse Works

Instead of similar chunks (RAG) or entities (GraphRAG), Recurse extracts *semantic structure* – understanding what sources argue, what supports those arguments, how different pieces relate – and maps out how these elements connect.

This structure lets information reference other information across your entire knowledge base. An argument in one paper connects to supporting data from three others. A technique described in one source links to examples of its use elsewhere. Your knowledge becomes a web of relationships, not a collection of isolated text chunks.

When you (or your AI agent) query Recurse, you don't just get back similar text – you can trace connections, follow supporting evidence, explore how ideas relate. Discover connections that weren't even explicit in the original sources.

### Core Features

<Cards>
  <Card href="/docs/concepts/frames" title="Semantic Frames" icon="cube">
    Recurse extracts semantic units with typed relationships – not just text chunks or entities. Arguments link to evidence, decisions connect to discussions, concepts nest within hierarchies. Frame types adapt to your content.
  </Card>

  <Card href="/docs/guides/using-the-proxy" title="Context Injection" icon="arrow-right-left">
    Route AI requests through our proxy. Context bundles matching your query get assembled and enriched before forwarding to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any provider. One line change in your code.
  </Card>

  <Card href="/docs/concepts/adaptive-schemas" title="Emergent Structure" icon="sparkles">
    No predefined schemas required. Recurse discovers frame patterns in your content automatically – research papers, code docs, meeting notes – and adapts to your domain as you upload more.
  </Card>

  <Card href="/docs/concepts/temporal-versioning" title="Living Memory" icon="git-branch">
    Knowledge evolves without losing history. New information updates previous understanding with timestamps and diffs. Track how understanding changed over months or years.
  </Card>

  <Card href="/docs/concepts/subscriptions" title="Source Subscriptions" icon="rss">
    Subscribe to newsletters, RSS feeds, or docs for continuous ingestion. New content gets processed automatically. Your knowledge stays current without manual uploads.
  </Card>

  <Card href="/docs/concepts/streams" title="Context Streams" icon="broadcast">
    Subscribe to expert-curated collections. One click gives you (or your AI model) domain-specific knowledge – AI safety research, engineering best practices, legal precedents – maintained by experts.

## Ways to Use Recurse

**Chat interface**: [chat.recurse.cc](https://chat.recurse.cc) provides a familiar interface connected to your knowledge graph. Ask "how does X relate to Y?" and navigate your structured knowledge conversationally. Tag collections, explore relationships, query across everything you've accumulated. No code required.

**Proxy**: Route requests from any AI provider through our proxy for automatic context injection. Change one line in your existing code – context bundles matching your query intent get assembled and enriched before forwarding to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other provider.

**API integration**: Build custom experiences on top of the knowledge substrate. Your AI agents get full programmatic access to frame extraction, relationship navigation, and graph operations. Direct control over uploads, search, and retrieval.

Use whichever fits your workflow – or combine them.

## What Makes Recurse Different

If you've worked with RAG systems or knowledge graphs, you might wonder what makes Recurse different. Here's a quick comparison:

| Feature | Traditional RAG | GraphRAG | Recurse |
|:--------|:----------------|:---------|:--------|
| **Understanding** | Similarity matching | Entity extraction | Semantic structure |
| **Navigation** | Flat chunk retrieval | Entity relationships | Recursive traversal |
| **Adaptation** | Static | Fixed ontology | Emergent schemas |
| **Memory** | Session-based | Static graph | Living substrate |
