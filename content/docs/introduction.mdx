Most AI memory systems optimize for one thing: similarity. You ask a question, get back the most similar chunks, and that's it. This works fine if you already know what you're looking for. But it systematically prevents discovery—you can't find connections you didn't know existed, can't stumble onto context from unexpected places, can't explore ideas that branch away from your original query.

Recurse doesn't treat memory as a similarity search problem. It treats it as a living structure—one you can navigate yourself and share with others. The question isn't "what's most similar?" but "what connects?", "what supports this?", "how did understanding evolve?" Those are fundamentally different questions, and they require fundamentally different infrastructure.

## Why Similarity Isn't Enough

Static similarity metrics treat memory as an optimization problem: minimize distance in embedding space, maximize relevance scores, return top-k results. But understanding doesn't work that way. Ideas connect across conceptual distances. Evidence comes from unexpected domains. Insights emerge from juxtapositions that wouldn't score highly on similarity.

Recurse is built on different principles: **structure over similarity**, **relationships over rankings**, **evolution over static storage**. The system doesn't just ask "what's most similar?"—it asks "what connects?", "what supports this?", "how did this evolve?", "what contradicts this?"

This is infrastructure for sense-making, not just retrieval. For exploration, not just question-answering. For building understanding, not just finding facts.

## How Recurse Works

### Structured Understanding

Traditional retrieval systems store your text and search for similar chunks when you query them. Recurse extracts semantic structure instead—understanding what sources argue, what supports those arguments, how different pieces relate—and maps out how these elements actually connect.

This structure lets information reference other information across your entire knowledge base. An argument in one paper can connect to supporting data from three others. A technique described in one source links to examples of its use elsewhere. Your knowledge becomes a web of relationships, not a collection of isolated text chunks.

When you (or your AI agent) query, you don't just get similar text—you can trace connections, follow supporting evidence, explore how ideas relate. You can discover connections that weren't even explicit in the original sources.

### Context Injection

Route your AI requests through our proxy. Context bundles matching your query intent get automatically injected. Your research accumulates across sessions. Writing draws from previous research. Each interaction builds on accumulated understanding without manual context management.

### Living Knowledge

Knowledge evolves over time. When new information updates previous understanding, Recurse doesn't delete the old—it preserves the evolution with timestamps and diffs showing what changed and why. Track how understanding of a topic evolved over months or years.

### Context Streams

Subscribe to expert-curated collections. One click gives your AI access to domain-specific knowledge maintained by experts. AI safety research, engineering best practices, legal precedents—all continuously updated, automatically available when relevant.

## Two Ways to Use Recurse

**For Non-Technical Users**: [chat.recurse.cc](https://chat.recurse.cc) provides a familiar chat interface where you can interact with your knowledge base, tag collections, explore connections, and ask "how does X relate to Y?"

**For Builders**: The API lets you integrate Recurse into your applications—automatic context injection via proxy, programmatic uploads, search, and more. Build AI applications with structured memory, not just similarity search.

## What Makes Recurse Different

Most AI memory systems optimize for similarity—you ask a question, get back similar chunks. Recurse extracts structure instead: what documents argue, what supports those arguments, how ideas connect.

| Approach | Understanding | Navigation | Evolution |
|----------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| **Traditional RAG** | Keyword matching | Linear search | Static |
| **GraphRAG** | Predefined relationships | Fixed traversal | Manual updates |
| **Recurse** | **Structural extraction** | **Intent-aware** | **Temporal versioning** |

This transforms retrieval from similarity matching into structural navigation through your knowledge.
