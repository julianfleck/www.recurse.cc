## Your AI’s Missing Memory

Imagine this: You spend hours researching a complex topic with Claude, building up a rich understanding through conversation. Then you switch to ChatGPT for writing, and suddenly your AI has amnesia—all that accumulated knowledge? Gone.

**Recurse solves this problem.** It creates a personal knowledge layer that follows you across any AI system. Your documents become smarter over time, and your AI assistants remember everything.

---

## What Makes Recurse Different

Most AI tools treat each conversation as a blank slate. Recurse changes that by creating a living knowledge substrate that interconnects every new piece of information with all your existing knowledge.

| Technology | Approach | What You Get |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **Standard RAG** | Flat text chunks | Basic retrieval, loses context |
| **GraphRAG** | Predefined relationships | Structured but rigid connections |
| **RAGE** | Living knowledge substrate | Automatic semantic extraction, nested relationships |

Unlike traditional systems that need manual graph maintenance or predefined ontologies, Recurse automatically detects and extracts structural units alongside their semantic meaning and purpose. When you upload a document, it doesn't just store text—it understands the relationships between ideas and connects them to everything you've already learned.

---

## A New Approach to Knowledge

Recurse responds to queries not with flat chunks of text, but with nested trees and subgraphs that preserve the rich relationships between concepts. This means when you ask about a research topic, you don't get isolated facts—you get a structured understanding that shows how ideas connect and build upon each other.

The system maintains complete traceability from any piece of information back to its original source, enabling accurate citation while supporting sophisticated knowledge discovery workflows. Your knowledge grows organically as you use it, with each new document automatically connecting to relevant existing concepts.

---

## How It Works (The Simple Version)

Upload your content—documents, notes, articles, whatever you want your AI to remember—and Recurse transforms it into a living knowledge substrate. Ask questions naturally, and the system finds relevant information while preserving the rich context and relationships between ideas. The more you use it, the smarter it gets at connecting concepts across all your content.

This creates a foundation where knowledge sharing becomes fundamentally easier. In the future, you'll be able to subscribe to other knowledge streams, combining insights from trusted sources with your own understanding while maintaining complete control over what you share.

## Why People Choose Recurse

Individual users love Recurse because it eliminates the frustration of losing context when switching between AI systems. Researchers maintain their intellectual momentum across different tools, writers build on previous insights without starting over, and learners create personal knowledge bases that grow smarter over time.

Teams benefit from shared knowledge that maintains individual ownership and control. Each team member can contribute to collective understanding while keeping their own knowledge streams private and portable.

Developers appreciate the clean API design that integrates seamlessly with existing systems. The privacy-first approach ensures user data ownership, while the flexible architecture supports everything from simple chatbots to sophisticated AI agent networks.
