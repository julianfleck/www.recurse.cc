          Add and ingest a new document with full processing pipeline.


          This endpoint triggers the complete RAGE for document analysis and
          processing.


          ## Processing Pipeline


          | Step | Description | Purpose |

          |------|-------------|---------|

          | **Deduplication Check** | Verifies if document already exists |
          Avoid duplicate processing |

          | **Document Storage** | Saves to vault with metadata | Persistent
          storage |

          | **Semantic Parsing** | Extracts sections and structure | Document
          organization |

          | **Frame Extraction** | Identifies semantic frames using AI | Meaning
          extraction |

          | **Graph Storage** | Persists to Neo4j with relationships | Knowledge
          graph building |

          | **Embedding Generation** | Creates vector embeddings for search |
          Semantic search capability |


          ## Key Features


          | Feature | Description | Benefit |

          |---------|-------------|---------|

          | **Parallel Processing** | Large documents processed in chunks |
          Improved performance |

          | **Background Jobs** | Returns immediately with job ID for tracking |
          Non-blocking operation |

          | **Smart Deduplication** | Detects existing content automatically |
          Efficiency |

          | **Progress Tracking** | Monitor status via `/jobs/{job_id}` |
          Transparency |


          ## Document Types


          | Type | Description | Use Case |

          |------|-------------|----------|

          | `research_paper` | Academic papers with formal structure |
          Scientific content |

          | `article` | News articles and blog posts | Journalistic content |

          | `personal_note` | Informal notes and reflections | Personal
          knowledge |

          | `reference_document` | Documentation and reference materials |
          Technical content |

          You can optionally include a "collection" field (string) in the request body to scope the ingested material to a specific collection tied to your user account.

          ## Request Examples


          **Example Usage:**

          ```bash

          curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/documents \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d '{
              "text": "Your document content here...",
              "title": "Document Title",
              "document_type_hint": "research_paper",
              "collection": "my-research",
              "metadata": {"author": "John Doe", "tags": ["AI", "research"]}
            }'
          ```


          Returns a job ID for tracking processing status.

          ## Using Collections for Retrieval
          If you specify a collection during upload, you can later filter search and retrieval operations to only include content from that specific collection. This helps organize and scope your knowledge base for different projects or topics. For example, use the collection parameter in search endpoints to retrieve only from 'my-research'.
