title: Source subscriptions

**Turn all the stuff you meant to read into living context for your AI models**

You subscribe to brilliant newsletters, then life happens. With **recurse**, those unread issues still work for you. We ingest trusted sources you choose and turn them into context your models can actually use at chat time—so your AI stays current without you doom-scrolling. It gets smarter the longer it runs. Use it in our chat or keep your stack as-is via our OpenAI-compatible proxy.

## What’s happening under the hood?
We build a private, evolving knowledge layer from your sources and surface only the minimal snippets needed to answer your question. You stay in control.

## Why would I want that?
Because suddenly you can ask your AI models things like this and expect answers that make sense:

> Give me 5 themes from my `policy` newsletters in the last 2 weeks. Cite issues.


## Code block

```css
:where(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {

## How to set up source subscriptions

<div className='fd-steps [&_h4]:fd-step'>

#### Add source subscriptions
Point recurse at your newsletters/feeds.

#### Ask in chat
Ask what’s new, compare takes, or triage what’s worth reading.

#### Set up proxy
Swap your baseURL to our proxy to get the same context in your own apps.
