# Deleting Content

Remove content and individual nodes from your knowledge graph.

Delete content and all its associated child nodes (sections, frames, metadata):

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/documents/{doc_id}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "deletion_type": "full",
  "document_id": "doc_ai_research_2024",
  "deleted": {
    "documents": 1,
    "sections": 5,
    "frames": 23,
    "relationships": null,
    "vault_files": 1
  },
  "preserved": {
    "shared_frames": 2,
    "shared_frame_ids": ["frame_abc123", "frame_def456"]
  },
  "cancelled_jobs": [],
  "warnings": ["2 frame(s) with external references will be preserved. Use force=true to delete all frames."]
}
```

> **Note:** Frames that are referenced by other documents are automatically **preserved** when deleting content. This maintains graph connectivity so those frames can still be found via traversal from other documents. Only frames exclusive to the deleted document are removed.

### Dry Run Mode

Preview what will be deleted without making changes:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/documents/{doc_id}?dry_run=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Force Deletion

By default, frames that are referenced by other documents are preserved. Use `force=true` to delete **all** frames regardless of external references:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/documents/{doc_id}?force=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

> **Warning:** Using `force=true` may break graph connectivity if other documents reference the deleted frames. Only use this when you want a complete cleanup.

### Job Cancellation

When you delete a document that is still being processed, any running ingestion jobs are automatically cancelled. This saves costs by stopping unnecessary processing.

The response includes information about cancelled jobs:

```json
{
  "cancelled_jobs": [
    {"job_id": "ingest_abc123_1234567890", "tasks_revoked": 5}
  ]
}
```

You can also [manually cancel jobs](/api-documentation/jobs/job_id-get#cancelling-jobs) via the Jobs API.

### Orphan Cleanup

By default, orphaned nodes (nodes with no relationships) are automatically cleaned up after deletion:

```bash
# Cleanup enabled (default)
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/documents/{doc_id}?cleanup_orphans=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# Disable cleanup
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/documents/{doc_id}?cleanup_orphans=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Orphan cleanup removes nodes that have no relationships and disconnected metadata clusters.

## Deleting Individual Nodes

Delete a single node from the graph:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/node/{node_id}/delete" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "node_id": "frame_claim_123",
  "labels": ["Frame", "Claim"],
  "deleted": {
    "nodes": 1,
    "relationships": 3
  },
  "warnings": []
}
```

### Dry Run for Nodes

Preview node deletion:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/node/{node_id}/delete?dry_run=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Restrictions

- Cannot delete authentication/identity nodes (User, Role, APIKey, Permission, Identity)
- Document nodes must be deleted via `/documents/{id}` endpoint
- Only nodes you own can be deleted

## Query Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `dry_run` | boolean | `false` | Preview deletion without making changes |
| `force` | boolean | `false` | Delete ALL frames, including those with external references |
| `cleanup_orphans` | boolean | `true` | Remove orphaned nodes after deletion |

## Examples

### Delete Content

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/documents/doc_my_document" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Delete a Specific Frame

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/node/frame_claim_123/delete" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Preview Before Deleting

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.recurse.dev/documents/{doc_id}?dry_run=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```
