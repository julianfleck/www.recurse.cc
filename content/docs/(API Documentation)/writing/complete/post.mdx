          Generate intelligent text completions using your knowledge base and
          AI.


          This endpoint provides AI-powered text completion that leverages your
          knowledge graph

          to suggest contextually relevant and semantically coherent text
          continuations.


          ## Key Features


          | Feature | Description | Benefit |

          |---------|-------------|---------|

          | **AI-Powered Completion** | Uses OpenRouter LLMs for intelligent
          text generation | High-quality suggestions |

          | **Knowledge Integration** | Leverages graph database for contextual
          suggestions | Relevant content |

          | **Frame-Aware** | Incorporates semantic frame understanding |

          ## Request Examples


          **Minimal Request:**

          ```json

          {
            "text": "Neural networks learn through"
          }

          ```


          **Full Request:**

          ```json

          {
            "text": "The primary advantage of transformer architectures over RNNs is",
