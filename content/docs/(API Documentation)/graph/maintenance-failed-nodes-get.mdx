          Get nodes that need maintenance (failed or partial processing).


          This endpoint retrieves nodes that have failed processing or are in
          partial

          states, enabling the maintenance system to identify and retry
          operations.


          **Features:**

          - **Status Filtering**: Filter by specific failure types

          - **Batch Processing**: Get up to 1000 nodes for batch operations

          - **Exclude Complete**: Option to filter out completed nodes

          - **Retry Information**: Includes retry counts and error details


          **Response Format:**
