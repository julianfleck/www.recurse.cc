          Get comprehensive graph statistics.

          **Features:**
          - **Node Counts**: Total nodes by type and label
          - **Relationship Counts**: Total relationships by type
          - **Graph Metrics**: Density, connectivity, depth analysis
          - **Performance Data**: Query execution times and database info

          **Statistics Included:**
          - **Total Counts**: Nodes, relationships, node types
          - **Document Analysis**: Documents, sections, frames breakdown
          - **Relationship Types**: CONTAINS, SUPPORTS, ILLUSTRATES, etc.
          - **Graph Health**: Orphaned nodes, disconnected components
          - **Performance**: Response times, index utilization

          **Response Format:**
          ```json
          {
            "total_nodes": 15420,
            "total_relationships": 28650,
            "node_counts_by_type": {
              "Document": 145,

              "Frame": 8950,
              "Chunk": 5085
            },
            "relationship_counts_by_type": {
              "CONTAINS": 1385,
              "SUPPORTS": 12400,
              "ILLUSTRATES": 8950,
              "CITES": 5915
            },
            "graph_metrics": {
              "avg_degree": 3.71,
              "max_depth": 8,
              "connected_components": 1
            },
            "query_time": 0.125
