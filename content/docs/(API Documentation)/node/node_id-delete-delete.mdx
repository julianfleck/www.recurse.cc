          Delete a single non-auth graph node by id.


          Safety rules:

          - Disallows deletion of authentication/identity nodes.

          - Disallows deletion of `Document` nodes (use /documents/{id} instead
          to preserve multi-owner safety).

          - Uses scoped client to enforce data ownership/visibility.

          - Optionally removes zero-degree orphans and disconnected metadata
          clusters.
