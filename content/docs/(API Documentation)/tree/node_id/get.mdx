          Retrieve a hierarchical tree structure with configurable traversal and
          field selection.


          **Purpose**: Retrieve a hierarchical tree structure starting from a
          node, with configurable

          traversal direction and depth.


          **Returns**: A tree structure containing the root node and its related
          nodes (children, parents,

          or both) up to the specified depth. Always includes all sections and
          frames within the traversal scope.


          ## Search Parameters (HOW to traverse)


          - `direction`: Traversal direction (children, parents, both)

          - `depth`: Maximum traversal depth (0-20)

          - `limit`: Maximum number of nodes to return


          ## Field Selection (WHAT to return)


          - `field_set`: Predefined field set (basic, content, metadata,
          relationships, all)

          - `include_fields`: Additional fields to include

          - `exclude_fields`: Fields to exclude


          ## Filtering Options


          - `node_types`: Filter by node types (Document, Section, Frame)

          - `relationship_types`: Filter by relationship types (CONTAINS,
          SUPPORTS, etc.)

          - `frame_types`: Filter by frame types (claim, evidence, method, etc.)


          ## Examples


          ```bash

          # Get children with basic fields

          GET /tree/abc123?direction=children&depth=3&field_set=basic


          # Get parents with content and relationships

          GET
          /tree/abc123?direction=parents&depth=2&field_set=content&include_fields=relationships


          # Filter by node types

          GET
          /tree/abc123?direction=children&node_types=Frame,Section&field_set=content

          ```

Retrieve a hierarchical tree structure with configurable traversal and field selection.

**Purpose**: Retrieve a hierarchical tree structure starting from a node, with configurable
traversal direction and depth.

**Returns**: A tree structure containing the root node and its related nodes (children, parents,
or both) up to the specified depth. Always includes all sections and frames within the traversal scope.

## Search Parameters (HOW to traverse)

- `direction`: Traversal direction (children, parents, both)
- `depth`: Maximum traversal depth (0-20)
- `limit`: Maximum number of nodes to return

## Field Selection (WHAT to return)

- `field_set`: Predefined field set (basic, content, metadata, relationships, all)
- `include_fields`: Additional fields to include
- `exclude_fields`: Fields to exclude

## Filtering Options

- `node_types`: Filter by node types (Document, Section, Frame)
- `relationship_types`: Filter by relationship types (CONTAINS, SUPPORTS, etc.)
- `frame_types`: Filter by frame types (claim, evidence, method, etc.)

## Examples

```bash
# Get children with basic fields
GET /tree/abc123?direction=children&depth=3&field_set=basic

# Get parents with content and relationships
GET /tree/abc123?direction=parents&depth=2&field_set=content&include_fields=relationships

# Filter by node types
GET /tree/abc123?direction=children&node_types=Frame,Section&field_set=content
