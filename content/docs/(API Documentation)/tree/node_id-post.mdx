          Retrieve a tree structure using POST with full unified filtering
          support.


          **Purpose**: Same as GET endpoint but supports complex filtering
          through JSON body.


          **Returns**: A tree structure with fields controlled by the filters.


          ## Request Structure


          ```json

          {
            "direction": "children",
            "depth": 3,
            "limit": 100,
            "filters": {
              "field_set": "content",
              "include_fields": ["relationships"],
              "node_types": ["Frame", "Section"],
              "frame_types": ["claim", "evidence"],
              "min_confidence": 0.8
            }
          }

          ```


          ## Examples


          ```bash

          # Basic tree traversal

          POST /tree/abc123

          {

              "field_set": "basic"
            }
