          Resume processing for a document with incomplete sections.


          This endpoint identifies sections that failed during processing and

          them for frame extraction, embedding generation, and metadata
          extraction.

          - **Smart Resume**: Only processes incomplete sections

          - **Force Retry**: Option to retry all sections regardless of status

          - **Parallel Processing**: Uses existing Celery worker infrastructure

          - **Status Tracking**: Returns job ID for monitoring progress


          **Parameters:**

          - `force_retry_all`: If true, reprocess all sections even if complete


          **Use Cases:**

          - Recover from temporary LLM service outages

          - Retry sections that failed due to rate limiting

          - Update processing after system improvements
