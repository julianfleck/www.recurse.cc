          Delete a document by ID with ownership checks, safety analysis, and
          optional dry-run.


          Behavior:

          - If document has multiple owners, only the OWNS edge for the current
          scope is removed.

          - If frames have incoming references from other documents, deletion is
          blocked unless force=true.

          - When fully deleted, associated Sections and Frames are removed and
          the vault file is deleted.
