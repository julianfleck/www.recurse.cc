## Understand RAGE Concepts

### What is RAGE?
RAGE transforms your documents into a **living knowledge substrate** - a dynamic network of connected information that your AI systems can access and build upon.

### Key Concepts

<Cards>
  <Card title="Semantic Blocks" icon="filetext">
    Your documents are broken down into meaningful units that capture concepts, arguments, evidence, and relationships. Each block represents a complete thought or piece of information.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge Graph" icon="brain">
    Information connects naturally, forming a web of relationships that mirrors how humans think and learn. Concepts link together based on meaning, not just keywords.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Portability" icon="share2">
    Your knowledge follows you across different AI systems - no more losing context when switching between tools. One knowledge base, accessible everywhere.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Engineering" icon="brain">
    RAGE automatically structures your knowledge for optimal AI consumption. Context engineering ensures that when you query information, you get not just relevant facts, but the complete context needed for accurate AI responses.
  </Card>
</Cards>

### How It Works

<Accordions type="single" collapsible>
  <Accordion title="1. Add Content">
    Upload documents, articles, or any text content to your knowledge base through the dashboard or API.

    | What You Do | What RAGE Does |
    |-------------|----------------|
    | Select and upload your files<br />Choose content sources<br />Initiate the ingestion process | **AI Processing**<br />Analyzes and extracts semantic relationships<br />Identifies concepts, arguments, and connections<br />Creates structured knowledge units |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Query Information">
    Search for specific concepts, ask questions, or request context about your content.

    | What You Do | What RAGE Does |
    |-------------|----------------|
    | Enter search terms or questions<br />Specify search parameters<br />Request contextual information | **Graph Traversal**<br />Navigates the knowledge graph<br />Finds relevant information and relationships<br />Provides comprehensive context |
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Integrate with AI">
    Use the retrieved context with any AI system through our API or integrations.

    | What You Do | What RAGE Does |
    |-------------|----------------|
    | Connect to your preferred AI tools<br />Send contextual information<br />Receive enhanced AI responses | **Context Assembly**<br />Structures information for optimal AI consumption<br />Formats data for different AI systems<br />Ensures response quality and accuracy |
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## First Steps

### Upload Your First Document

<div className='fd-steps [&_h4]:fd-step'>
#### Prepare Content
Find a document, article, or text you'd like to add to your knowledge base.

#### Upload via Dashboard
In your dashboard, click "Upload" and select your file or paste text content.

#### Wait for Processing
RAGE will analyze your content and make it searchable. This usually takes a few seconds to a minute.

#### Test a Search
Try searching for concepts from your document to see how RAGE understands and connects information.
</div>

## Integration Options

### API Access
For developers who want to integrate RAGE programmatically:

<div className='fd-steps [&_h4]:fd-step'>
#### Generate API Key
Go to Settings â†’ API Keys in your dashboard.

#### Copy Your Key
Save the API key securely - it's shown only once.

#### Make Test Call
Use the API key to upload content or search your knowledge base.
</div>

### Third-Party Integrations
RAGE works with popular AI tools and platforms:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Connect with AI assistants
- **API Integration**: Direct API access for custom applications
- **Browser Extensions**: Save web content directly to your knowledge base

## Understanding Your Data

### Privacy & Security
- Your data is encrypted and stored securely
- You maintain full ownership and control
- Content is only accessible by you (unless explicitly shared)

### Data Processing
- Documents are analyzed for semantic meaning
- Relationships between concepts are automatically discovered
- Search results are ranked by relevance and context

### Storage & Limits
- Check your plan limits in the dashboard
- Documents are stored indefinitely
- Processing history is maintained for reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Upload Not Working**
- Check file format (PDF, DOC, TXT, MD supported)
- Ensure file size is under plan limits
- Try refreshing the page

**Search Not Finding Content**
- Wait for processing to complete (check status in dashboard)
- Try different search terms
- Content needs to be fully processed before it's searchable

**API Key Issues**
- Regenerate your API key if lost
- Check that you're using the correct key
- Ensure proper authentication headers
