**Turn your private knowledge into public value — and benefit from others’ curation.** Source subscriptions let you follow public collections curated by the community or publish your own. Anything you subscribe to becomes *live context* your models can draw from automatically at chat time — no copy-paste, no tab juggling.

## What are source subscriptions?

A source subscription is a link to a public **context collection**: a set of sources (newsletters, docs, feeds, notes) that curators maintain together. When you subscribe, Recurse ingests and continuously parses those sources into your **personal knowledge layer**. At answer time, Recurse selects only the minimal, relevant snippets and injects them into your model prompt with citations. Your AI stays current; you stay focused.

## How it works under the hood (Recurse / RAGE)

Recurse runs on the RAGE pipeline, which turns raw content into a graph the model can reason over. New items are parsed into semantic **frames** (claims, evidence, definitions, examples, etc.), validated, and linked to related material you already have. This structure makes retrieval precise and explainable: for a given question, Recurse gathers the strongest candidates, expands them with immediate graph context (parents, children, neighbors), reranks for intent, and returns compact, attributed snippets to the model. The result is automatic context injection that is **relevant, minimally sufficient, and source-aware**.

You don’t need to learn any of this to benefit from it — but it explains why subscribing to well-maintained collections tends to outperform ad-hoc web search and manual prompting.

## Why subscribe or contribute?

Good collections reduce blind spots and keep you up to date. Because multiple maintainers can propose additions and edits, coverage improves over time and stale items get replaced. As you use a collection, your feedback, saves, and successful answers become quiet signals that help curators refine scope and quality.

If you curate, publishing a collection lets others benefit from your research while keeping ownership of your originals. You can start small (e.g., “policy tech briefs I actually trust”) and grow with collaborators.

## Subscribing

When you subscribe, you add the collection’s sources to your account’s context pool. Recurse ingests new items on a schedule, deduplicates near-identical content across collections, and preserves provenance. At chat time:

- only the most relevant snippets are surfaced,
- every snippet carries its source and link,
- and the context is scoped to the current space/conversation so unrelated data stays out of the way.

Unsubscribe at any time; your subsequent answers will stop drawing from that stream. You can also pause a collection without removing it.

## Publishing and collaborating

Create a collection from the dashboard or API, describe who it’s for, and add a few seed sources. Invite co-maintainers, set lightweight contribution rules (what belongs, update cadence, link hygiene), and review suggestions from subscribers. Collections work best when they’re focused, have clear inclusion criteria, and show recent activity.

**Visibility.** Keep collections private, share with a workspace, or make them public so others can subscribe. Public collections are listed with simple health indicators (last update, coverage breadth, subscriber signals) to help readers judge whether it’s worth adding.

> **Note on rewards.** A creator rewards mechanism is planned, so maintainers can opt in to receive value from popular subscriptions. Until then, focus is on utility, transparency, and trust.

## Query formatting

Scope answers to specific subscriptions directly in your prompt:

- `#collection-slug` targets a collection you’re subscribed to
- `@username` targets a curator whose public collections you follow

Example:

```
write a detailed report about the current state of retrieval augmented generation #rag-best-practices @neo4j
```

Notes:

- Tags are case-insensitive and must match subscribed collection slugs
- Mentions consider the curator’s public collections you follow
- Without tags, Recurse selects from your active context as usual

## Privacy and control

Recurse respects source ownership and user intent. Subscriptions don’t “dump” raw documents into someone else’s vault; they point to sources that *you* ingest into *your* graph, with clear attribution and an audit trail. You can scope which conversations use which collections, and you can export or remove your data at any time.

## Getting started

<div className='fd-steps [&_h4]:fd-step'>

#### Discover collections in your domain
Browse the directory to find active, well-maintained sets that match your work.

#### Subscribe with a click
Add a collection to your account; Recurse handles ingestion and continuous updates.

#### Use your AI as usual
Ask questions in chat. Relevant context from your subscriptions will be injected automatically with citations.

#### Contribute or publish
Suggest sources to existing collections, or start your own and invite collaborators.
