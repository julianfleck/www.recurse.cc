Manual ingestion allows you to directly add content to your Recurse knowledge base. This is the most straightforward way to build your knowledge base with specific documents, articles, or text you want to make searchable.

## Via Web Dashboard

### Upload Documents

<div className='fd-steps [&_h4]:fd-step'>
#### Access Upload Section
Log into your dashboard and click "Upload" in the main navigation.

#### Select Files
Choose documents from your computer. Supported formats:
- **PDF**: Research papers, reports, presentations
- **Word Documents**: DOC, DOCX files
- **Text Files**: TXT, MD, CSV
- **Web Pages**: HTML files

#### Add Metadata (Optional)
Enhance your documents with additional information:
- **Title**: Custom title for the document
- **Tags**: Keywords for better organization
- **Source**: Where the document came from
- **Notes**: Additional context or reminders

#### Upload and Process
Click "Upload" and wait for processing. You'll see a progress indicator and receive a notification when complete.
</div>

### Paste Text Content

<div className='fd-steps [&_h4]:fd-step'>
#### Access Text Upload
In the upload section, click "Paste Text" or "Add Content".

#### Enter Your Content
Paste or type text directly into the editor. This works well for:
- Blog posts or articles
- Meeting notes
- Research findings
- Code documentation
- Personal notes

#### Format Your Content
Use Markdown formatting for better structure:
```markdown
# Main Topic
## Subsection
- Bullet points
- More information

**Bold text** and *italic text*
```

#### Add Metadata
Same as document uploads - title, tags, source information.

#### Save and Process
Click "Save" to add the content to your knowledge base.
</div>

## Via API

### Direct Text Upload

For programmatic content addition, use the documents API endpoint:

<Tabs items={['cURL', 'Python', 'JavaScript']} defaultIndex={0}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.recurse.cc/documents" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "title": "My Research Notes",
        "text": "# Research Findings\n\nHere are my key findings from the study...",
        "document_type_hint": "research",
        "metadata": {
          "tags": ["research", "findings"],
          "source": "personal_notes"
        }
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    url = "https://api.recurse.cc/documents"
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
    }

    data = {
        "title": "My Research Notes",
        "text": "# Research Findings\n\nHere are my key findings from the study...",
        "document_type_hint": "research",
        "metadata": {
            "tags": ["research", "findings"],
            "source": "personal_notes"
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
    print(response.json())
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.recurse.cc/documents', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        title: 'My Research Notes',
        text: '# Research Findings\n\nHere are my key findings from the study...',
        document_type_hint: 'research',
        metadata: {
          tags: ['research', 'findings'],
          source: 'personal_notes'
        }
      })
    });

    const result = await response.json();
    console.log(result);
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Upload from URLs

Automatically fetch and process content from web URLs:

<Tabs items={['cURL', 'Python']} defaultIndex={0}>
  <Tab value="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.recurse.cc/documents/upload" \
      -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
      -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -F "url=https://example.com/article.html" \
      -F "document_type_hint=article"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    url = "https://api.recurse.cc/documents/upload"
    files = {
        'url': (None, 'https://example.com/article.html'),
        'document_type_hint': (None, 'article')
    }
    headers = {
        'X-API-Key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    }

    response = requests.post(url, files=files, headers=headers)
    print(response.json())
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
