RAGE (Recursive, Agentic Graph Embeddings) is the engine underneath everything Recurse does. It's what turns unstructured sources into structured knowledge graphs.

You don't interact with RAGE directly—it operates in the background, handling source ingestion, frame extraction, relationship mapping, and query resolution. But understanding why it works the way it does helps explain what makes Recurse different from other retrieval systems.

## Why Recursive?

Knowledge doesn't exist in flat layers. An argument references evidence, that evidence was gathered using specific methods, those methods depend on theoretical assumptions, those assumptions connect back to other arguments. Ideas nest inside ideas.

RAGE treats this nesting explicitly. [Frames](/docs/concepts/frames) can contain other frames, which can contain other frames, creating structures of arbitrary depth. When you query about a decision, you can traverse down to the discussions that led there, the constraints that shaped those discussions, the prior decisions that established those constraints. Or move back up from a technical detail to the broader context that makes it meaningful.

This recursive structure mirrors how concepts actually relate—not just "these documents are similar" but "this argument depends on this evidence, which was gathered using this method, which addresses this criticism."

## Why Agentic?

Most retrieval systems are passive. They store what you give them and retrieve based on keyword matching or embedding similarity. RAGE actively interprets structure.

It doesn't just store your research paper—it extracts what claims are being made, what supports those claims, how the methodology works, what limitations exist, and how all these pieces connect. It recognizes when new information contradicts previous understanding and updates frames accordingly. It discovers patterns across your content and adapts its schema to match.

The system acts on your knowledge base: extracting structure, making connections, proposing updates, evolving its understanding as you add more content. It builds a representation that can be navigated, not just searched.

## Why Graph?

Structure without relationships is just organized text. RAGE treats knowledge as a web of typed connections. A `Claim` frame doesn't just link to related claims—it points to specific `Evidence` frames that support it, `Method` frames that describe how that evidence was gathered, and `Critique` frames that challenge its validity.

These aren't loose associations or similarity scores. They're explicit, typed relationships that preserve meaning: "supports," "contradicts," "depends on," "refines." You can follow these connections across your entire knowledge base—from a solution back to the problem it addresses, from a concept to all the examples that illustrate it, from a decision to every constraint that shaped it.

The graph structure enables traversal based on semantic relationships rather than text similarity.

---

## Why Embeddings?

Even with structure and relationships, you still need semantic understanding. RAGE maintains embeddings at multiple scales—from individual frame slots up through complete frame hierarchies—so it can match query intent to relevant structure even when the exact terminology differs.

When you ask about "performance bottlenecks," the system recognizes frames about "latency issues" and "throughput constraints" not because the words match, but because the semantic meaning aligns. The embeddings provide the fuzzy matching that makes natural language queries work, while the frame structure ensures that what gets retrieved actually answers what you meant to ask.

---

## The Architecture

Bringing these together: frames provide structure, recursion captures nesting, the graph preserves relationships, embeddings enable semantic matching, and the agentic behavior keeps it all current. [Adaptive schemas](/docs/concepts/adaptive-schemas) discover patterns in your content. [Temporal versioning](/docs/concepts/temporal-versioning) maintains history as understanding evolves.

RAGE isn't just an engine—it's the infrastructure that makes knowledge navigable rather than merely searchable.
