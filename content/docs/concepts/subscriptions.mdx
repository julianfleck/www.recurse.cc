The information landscape moves faster than humans can process. Documentation updates frequently. Best practices evolve. Your AI models answer from training data that's months old, missing recent changes.

**Source subscriptions monitor individual feeds for continuous ingestion.** When new content publishes—documentation updates, blog posts, changelogs—Recurse processes it automatically. Frames get extracted, relationships form, and through temporal versioning, your knowledge stays current as information evolves.

## How This Works

Consider asking about recent changes to a technical specification. Without subscriptions, your model answers from months-old training data. You manually check the documentation, realize it changed, copy-paste context. With a subscription monitoring that URL, the system has already ingested updates. Your query retrieves current frames—30 seconds instead of manual assembly.

The key difference: when content changes, Recurse doesn't just add the new version—it recognizes updates and revises existing frames. A source claimed "Method X achieves 95% accuracy." Months later, new information shows production accuracy is 73%. The system recognizes the contradiction and updates the frame, preserving version history. Your knowledge evolves without manual reconciliation.

**What gets subscribed:** 

Track changes for URLs (documentation sites, blogs, specific pages) or subscribe to RSS feeds (newsletters, podcasts, publication feeds). Additional source types like Twitter/Bluesky feeds coming soon.

The pattern: identify relevant sources, subscribe once, benefit continuously. You curate information flows rather than processing individual documents.
