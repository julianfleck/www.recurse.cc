<Callout type="info">
**Related concept**: Source Subscriptions work alongside **Context Streams** to enable continuous knowledge flow. While Source Subscriptions handle individual feeds, Context Streams provide expert-curated bundles. Learn about both to understand how they complement each other.

A source subscription flags an individual source—a newsletter, RSS feed, documentation site, or any regularly updated content—for continuous ingestion. When you subscribe to a source, Recurse periodically checks for new content and processes it into your knowledge substrate automatically.

## How Source Subscriptions Work

When you subscribe to a source:
1. Recurse periodically checks the source for new content
2. New content is automatically ingested and processed
3. Frames are extracted and added to your knowledge graph
4. Your knowledge stays current without manual uploads

---

## Examples

- Subscribe to the Latent Space podcast feed → new episodes get transcribed and ingested automatically
- Subscribe to a specific newsletter → each issue gets processed as it publishes  
- Subscribe to a documentation site → updates get tracked and ingested

Source subscriptions keep your AI models current with evolving information without manual uploads.

## When to Use Source Subscriptions

**Best for:**
- ✅ Regularly updated content (newsletters, blogs, docs)
- ✅ Staying current with evolving domains
- ✅ Automatic ingestion without manual work
- ✅ Individual feeds you want to track

**Consider Context Streams instead when:**
- You want curated collections of multiple sources
- You need expert-selected content bundles
- You want to share knowledge packages with others

## How Subscriptions Work with Streams

**Source Subscriptions** → continuous individual feeds  
**Context Streams** → curated bundles (can include source subscriptions)

A Context Stream might contain 5 source subscriptions + 10 specific documents + 3 synthesis notes. When you subscribe to the stream, you're getting all of that: the continuously updating feeds plus the curated static content plus the expert's own contributions.

---

## Benefits

Your AI models get access to:
- Current, continuously updated domain knowledge (via source subscriptions)
- Expert-curated context bundles (when subscriptions are included in Context Streams)
- Structural understanding of how concepts relate (via frame extraction across all sources)

You don't learn from these subscriptions in real-time—your models query them. The benefit to you is that your AI interactions draw from curated, up-to-date, structurally understood knowledge rather than static uploads or web searches.
