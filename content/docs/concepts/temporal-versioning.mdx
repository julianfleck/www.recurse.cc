Standard approaches to outdated knowledge present you with an unfortunate dilemma: either you keep the incorrect information (and risk propagating errors), or you delete the outdated content (and lose all historical context).

Recurse implements a third approach: with what we call **temporal versioning**, your knowledge graph becomes a **living memory substrate**. The system updated previously ingested content while preserving a complete history of how it's understanding evolved, quite similar to how humans learn, meta reflections included.

---

## How The Mechanism Works

When new content arrives, Recurse identifies related frames during ingestion—both those accessed frequently and those semantically connected to the new information. If the new content updates previous understanding, the system rewrites the frame with current knowledge while maintaining links to previous versions—complete with timestamps, diffs showing exactly what changed, and explanations of why the update happened.

---

## Concrete Example

You process a 2020 paper that claimed "state-of-the-art performance" for a particular method. Then in 2024, you process newer papers demonstrating superior approaches.

Rather than deleting the 2020 claim or just keeping it unchanged, Recurse updates it to something like:

```
This method achieved state-of-the-art performance in 2020 
(based on results from [Paper A]), but has since been 
superseded by [these newer approaches, 2024] which show 
[these specific improvements].
```

**The system preserves**:
- The previous version with its original timestamp
- A diff showing the specific changes made
- Links connecting the old and new versions
- Context explaining what evidence prompted the revision

When you query that claim now, you get access to both the current understanding and its complete evolution history. You can track how knowledge of a particular topic changed over time, what evidence prompted each revision, and when the understanding actually shifted.

## Evolution vs. Deletion

| Characteristic | Systems That Delete | Systems That Update | What Recurse Does |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Outdated content** | Removed entirely | Overwritten with new version | Evolved with version links preserved |
| **Historical access** | Lost permanently | Lost after overwrite | Maintained through timestamped versions |
| **Change tracking** | No record of change | No tracking of what changed | Complete diffs between versions |
| **Revision context** | Not preserved | Not preserved | Linked with full explanations |
| **Timeline views** | Not supported | Not supported | Full evolution history accessible |

While other memory systems "update" information, they don't maintain version history—the old content is simply overwritten. Knowledge accumulation without temporal context inevitably leads to either error propagation (when you keep outdated claims) or complete history loss (when you delete or overwrite them). What temporal versioning gives you is a way to maintain both currency and historical context simultaneously.

Together with the [self-evolving schema registry](/docs/concepts/adaptive-schemas), this is another mechanism that turns Recurse into a living knowledge substrate.
