title: Adaptive Schemas
description: Structure emerges from your content—no predefined schemas required

Most knowledge systems require you to define schemas before you can ingest anything. You sit down, design your ontology, map out your relationships, and then you can only process content that fits those predetermined structures.

Recurse works quite differently. Structure emerges from your content automatically (we call this **adaptive schemas**). The system discovers frame patterns in whatever you give it, and proposes new frame types when it encounters structures that don't match existing categories.

---

## How It Works

When you process research papers, Recurse develops frames for claims, evidence, and methods. Process software documentation, and it discovers patterns for function signatures, parameter specifications, and return types. Process meeting transcripts, and it identifies decision frames, discussion points, and action items.

The schema adapts to the patterns in your content rather than forcing your content into predetermined structures.

This is what makes it a **living structure**—it bootstraps itself by learning from what you upload.

## Why This Matters

This is what lets you process heterogeneous sources—research papers alongside meeting notes alongside code documentation—without having to manually design ontologies for each type.

| Approach | Schema Definition | Content Handling | Adaptation |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| **Without adaptive schemas** | Define upfront for every type | Lost or misclassified if doesn't fit | Requires manual redesign |
| **With adaptive schemas** | Emerges from content patterns | Automatically discovers new types | Adapts to your domain |

---

## What This Enables

**Flexible ingestion**: Upload any type of content—Recurse figures out the structure

**Domain adaptation**: The system learns patterns specific to your field

**Progressive refinement**: Schema improves as you process more content

**No upfront taxonomy**: Start uploading immediately, structure emerges
