          Execute multiple graph operations atomically using scoped client.


          **SECURITY NOTE:** This endpoint now properly uses scoped client
          methods

          to ensure data isolation and prevent unauthorized access to other
          users' data.


          **Features:**

          - **Data Scoping**: All operations respect user/API key data
          boundaries

          - **Atomic Transactions**: All-or-nothing operation guarantee

          - **High Performance**: Batch operations minimize round trips

          - **Mixed Operations**: Combine node and edge creation

          - **Auto ID Generation**: Automatic content-based ID generation


          **Use Cases:**

          - Document ingestion by workers

          - Bulk data imports with proper scoping

          - System maintenance operations
