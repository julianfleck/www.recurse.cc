## Understanding the Results

Recurse doesn't just search your documentsâ€”it understands them. When you ask a question, you'll see:

- **Direct answers** from your content
- **Related information** that connects to your question
- **Source citations** showing where each piece of information comes from
- **Contextual links** between different parts of your knowledge

This means your AI assistant can provide more accurate, relevant responses because it has access to your complete knowledge context.
